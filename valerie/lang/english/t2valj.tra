@0    = ~Well, that's not what I expected. No demons, but an ominous mystery all the same.~
@1    = ~You saw the letter. Your thoughts?~
@2    = ~So are you disappointed or pleased at how it turned out?~
@3    = ~Your mission's done. Guess you can head back to Amn now.~
@4    = ~Yeah, yeah. Get back in line and keep your thoughts to yourself.~
@5    = ~The plot thickens. Mulahey struck me as too stupid to do this on his own, frankly, but we have a thread to follow.~
@6    = ~Any Cowled Wizard insights into what happened down there?~
@7    = ~Where do you think this trail will lead?~
@8    = ~Are you planning to return to Amn now?~
@9    = ~I agree. Let's not waste time.~
@10   = ~Pleased, definitely. Kobolds are infinitely less worrying than demons, and we now have a trail to follow. Where it goes is anyone's guess.~
@11   = ~Guess you're done here. Planning to return to Amn?~
@12   = ~You have any Cowled Wizard insights into what went on in the mines?~
@13   = ~Any guesses where this thread will lead us?~
@14   = ~And we won't find where it goes standing around here.~
@15   = ~No. If it was just a kobold infestation I wouldn't be worried, but it's obviously nothing so simple. My mission might be complete, but my duty is not.~
@16   = ~You're really hung up on your duty, aren't you?~
@17   = ~What's your duty, exactly?~
@18   = ~So, any Cowled Wizard insights into what's going on?~
@19   = ~Have any guesses where this trail will lead?~
@20   = ~Then let's get going.~
@21   = ~Not really. We're trained in arcane matters, but aside from the poison itself, I don't know what to think. Making trouble *is* what Strifeleaders do, but so far this is outside my area of expertise.~
@22   = ~I guess you'l be heading back to Amn now.~
@23   = ~To Beregost. Oh. Well, in my professional and magical opinion... I have no idea, sorry.~
@24   = ~Not even any Cowled Wizard insights?~
@25   = ~Well, I guess you'l be heading back to Amn now.~
@26   = ~No sense standing around here, then.~
@27   = ~Uh, not exactly. I serve the people of Amn willingly. If innocents are in danger, I will act, and people are clearly still in danger. For now, we should probably get back to work.~
@28   = ~My duty is to stand between the innocent and the wicked, the destructive, and the depraved. That is Torm's charge to his followers. But that's a talk for another time, I guess. Let's get moving.~
@29   = ~Alright.~

@30   = ~Crawling around underground is not as enjoyable as the dwarves and gnomes say it is. A soft bed and a fine wine sound like just what the cleric ordered.~
@31   = ~I agree. Sounds good.~
@32   = ~What kind of clerics are you used to being around, if they'd order bed and wine?~
@33   = ~Any recommendations for a good vintage?~
@34   = ~Don't suppose you're looking for company, are you?~
@35   = ~I never imagined you having a fondness for wine.~
@36   = ~Enjoy yourself. I'm getting some sleep.~
@37   = ~Soft bed, fine wine, a good book... a perfect evening's relaxation after lots of fighting and killing.~
@38   = ~I didn't figure you as a wine-drinker.~
@39   = ~How about a pleasant evening's company?~
@40   = ~Relax while you can. I have a feeling we'll be back in the thick of it soon enough.~
@41   = ~I think that soft bed is calling to me. Good night, Valerie.~
@42   = ~Maybe I'm still soft from my apprenticeship, but I'm tired. A soft bed and a fine wine sound like just what the cleric ordered.~
@43   = ~Soft bed, fine wine, a good book... a perfect evening's relaxation after lots of walking and not infrequently fighting.~
@44   = ~Lliirans. The goddess of joy and revelry has taken over Waukeen's job as goddess of trade and wealth, so Athkatla suddenly has a Lliiran temple on every block, or so it feels like. They are a lively bunch.~
@45   = ~You say you serve Torm, though, right?~
@46   = ~Do you want some company to help enjoy the evening?~
@47   = ~Enjoy what downtime we have. We don't get enough of it.~
@48   = ~Don't stay up too late, Valerie.~
@49   = ~Hah. Like we can afford a really good wine without cutting into more practical expenses. The Tethyrian red is pretty good for the price, though.~
@50   = ~I never figured you for a wine connoisseur.~
@51   = ~Pleasant company can only make a good evening better. Would you mind if I joined you?~
@52   = ~Have fun for however long this lasts. We'll be back in the fray before long.~
@53   = ~I'm retiring for the night. I trust you'll go to bed before you lose the ability to walk?~
@54   = ~Everyone has their vices, <CHARNAME>, and wine is one of mine.~
@55   = ~If you'd like some pleasant company for this evening, I'll be pleased to oblige.~
@56   = ~Unwind all you like, but be ready to go in the morning. Adventure awaits.~
@57   = ~I'm going to bed now. The lavatory is that way if you need to throw up in the morning.~
@58   = ~Uh. <CHARNAME>? Maybe the wine's blurring my judgment, but... are you flirting with me?~
@59   = ~Trying to, at any rate.~
@60   = ~You're a beautiful woman, Valerie. I'd be delighted to buy you another glass of wine.~
@61   = ~Not my intention, but if you're saying you want me to...~
@62   = ~I think you got the wrong idea.~
@63   = ~Wow. Uh. I'm flattered, I think. But, uh, no thanks.~
@64   = ~It was worth a shot.~
@65   = ~Why not?~
@66   = ~Is it because I'm a woman?~
@67   = ~Good night, then.~
@68   = ~(Valerie laughs) Real smooth, <CHARNAME>, but I'm not, uh, interested.~
@69   = ~If you say so. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@70   = ~You're not my type. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@71   = ~You walk the adventurer's road, <CHARNAME>. I'm not a fan of the scrappy adventurer girl who of course turns out to be beautiful when she cleans up sort. Good night.~
@72   = ~Uh, no. Not at all. I prefer women, in fact. But, uh, this really isn't the time. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@73   = ~No! Uh, I mean... good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@74   = ~(Valerie's face turns scarlet) Uh. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@75   = ~Sigh. Fighting, killing, being hurt in turn. This is a pretty miserable life you've chosen, <CHARNAME>.~
@76   = ~Oh, I don't know about that. I think it's kind of fun.~
@77   = ~True, but it seems to be the only way to root out what's happening on the Sword Coast.~
@78   = ~If I can avenge Gorion, it will be worth the hardship.~
@79   = ~You did choose to come with me, as I recall.~
@80   = ~You're crazy. I suspected as much before, but now I know.~
@81   = ~Eeeee heee heee! I don't suffer from insanity, I love it!~
@82   = ~Come on. You really don't enjoy pushing yourself to the limit every day? I've never felt so alive!~
@83   = ~Stop moping around, Valerie. You're an adventurer now!~
@84   = ~Suit yourself. Good night.~
@85   = ~Oooookay. I'm going to back away very slowly. No sudden movements, Valerie, no sudden movements...~
@86   = ~Heh. I'm not so energetic. I find life in books and artistry with the Weave, not... violence. Guess if it works for you, though, it works. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@87   = ~Only as a means to an end, <CHARNAME>. Good night.~
@88   = ~Without getting the Cowled Wizards, Order of the Radiant Heart, or your Flaming Fist to send a strike force, probably so. Doesn't mean I enjoy the lifestyle.~
@89   = ~I don't, either, but we do what we must.~
@90   = ~I do, but each to their own.~
@91   = ~I enjoy it. I never feel so alive as when I'm on adventure.~
@92   = ~Just be ready in the morning.~
@93   = ~Indeed. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@94   = ~My taste for wine disappointed my father. He's one of Athkatla's more industrious brewers, and I think he supplies half the city's inns with beer.~
@95   = ~Sounds like a comfortable home life. How did you end up in the Cowled Wizards?~
@96   = ~You've never talked about your family before. Always your fellow apprentices.~
@97   = ~Great. Of all the sorceresses in the world, why did I have to get the drunk one?~
@98   = ~I see. Good night, Valerie.~
@99   = ~Very funny. I know my limits, <CHARNAME>. They're small. As you can see, I'm not exactly generous in weight or proportions.~
@100  = ~How did you end up in the Cowled Wizards anyway?~
@101  = ~You've only ever mentioned your fellow apprentices. What about your family?~
@102  = ~If you're sure I won't be down a functional sorceress in the morning, good night.~
@103  = ~The usual way. Managed to cast a spell when I was young, the Cowled Wizards showed up to investigate the disturbance, they took me with them when they left.~
@104  = ~That's a horrible thing to do to a child.~
@105  = ~Didn't your parents try to do something?~
@106  = ~You don't seem very sad about being taken away from your parents.~
@107  = ~So the Cowled Wizards can track the use of magic?~
@108  = ~I was taken by the Cowled Wizards when I was six. My fellow apprentices and my tutors were my family. Not unlike your situation, I suppose.~
@109  = ~And a necessary one. I doubt I could have learned to control my abilities otherwise, insofar as I *can* control them. Magic is dangerous, <CHARNAME>. Never forget that.~
@110  = ~But don't you miss your parents?~
@111  = ~I disagree. Magic isn't dangerous. The person who wields it is.~
@112  = ~Dangerous or no, the Cowled Wizards shouldn't take children away from their parents.~
@113  = ~I won't. Good night.~
@114  = ~...No. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@115  = ~If a child has a sword in her hands, the safest thing to do is take the sword away from her. <CHARNAME>, please go to bed or at least stop talking to me before you ruin what was a perfectly nice evening of mine.~
@116  = ~Easy for you to say, oh scion of Candlekeep. A literally textbook case of an ivory tower. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@117  = ~Do what? My mother was overjoyed to see me taken away. My father won't amass in his lifetime the kind of gold it would take to secure his daughter from the Cowled Wizards.~
@118  = ~I'm so sorry for you...~
@119  = ~Why was your mother so happy?~
@120  = ~Weren't you sad to leave your parents?~
@121  = ~I see. Good night.~
@122  = ~I'm not. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@123  = ~Because I was finally gone, of course. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@124  = ~I've made my peace with it. I'm not going to mope for decades on end over something I had no control over. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@125  = ~Do not cast arcane spells in Athkatla unless you have a license from the Cowled Wizards. Good night.~
@126  = ~I do. Torm, the Loyal Fury, god of duty, obedience, and loyalty. Odd for a sorceress to worship him, I know, and I do pray to Mystra on occasion, but magic is merely how I serve.~
@127  = ~Isn't that a bit contradictory? Praying to multiple gods?~
@128  = ~Why do you love duty so much? Odd for a sorceress, but odder still for a young woman like you.~
@129  = ~Why not Helm or Lathander? They seem to be the main do-gooder gods around here.~
@130  = ~Torm doesn't begrudge my prayers to Mystra, nor she my prayers to Torm. Clerics and paladins are the only ones the gods really expect to pray to one god alone.~
@131  = ~You're not a cleric? Could have fooled me.~
@132  = ~I'm surprised you never aspired to be a paladin.~
@133  = ~Are those the only gods you worship?~
@134  = ~Interesting. I'll leave you to your wine, then.~
@135  = ~(Valerie laughs) Don't think it hasn't occurred to me, but I can't seem to pursue religious studies without abandoning my magical development, something I'd rather not do. Were that I had elven or gnomish blood so I could multitask like they do...~
@136  = ~Me? A paladin? Be serious, <CHARNAME>! I don't have the muscle to do the big weapon and heavy armor routine, much less the fortitude to play knight! No, it's a mage's life for me. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@137  = ~I've prayed to Sune before, of course. What girl hasn't? And Oghma, when studying for an examination. But that's about it, I think. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@138  = ~I'm a sorceress, <CHARNAME>. I'm odd by definition. I never thought about it much. I can protect people, so I do. It just... comes naturally to me, I guess.~
@139  = ~Why not Mystra? Or Sune? I'd think those more your style as a young sorceress.~
@140  = ~I'm surprised you're not a cleric.~
@141  = ~Why did't you become a paladin, with that attitude?~
@142  = ~Each to their own, I guess. Good night.~
@143  = ~Oh I do pray to them, on occasion. But beauty is such a transient thing, and magic is simply a powerful, dangerous tool. Duty is my calling, <CHARNAME>. Good night.~
@144  = ~They're both too... short-sighted, for my tastes. Youth is fleeting and the sun sets each night. And unlike Helm, Torm knows that laws are not always just and we should never obey orders or laws blindly.~
@145  = ~Valerie, I worship Lathander. Please respect my faith while you're in my company.~
@146  = ~You *do* know I serve Helm, right?~
@147  = ~Heh. I'm surprised you're not a cleric.~
@148  = ~I see. Don't stay up too late, Valerie. We'll probably need your spells tomorrow.~
@149  = ~I do, and I respect the Morninglord's followers. He's just not a deity I can see myself ever following. Good night, <CHARNAME>, and may the Morninglord bless you with the dawn.~
@150  = ~I do, and I'm not about to launch a crusade against the Watcher and his followers. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@151  = ~Good night, <CHARNAME>.~

@152  = ~How did you get drawn into this mess in the first place, <CHARNAME>? Candlekeep is said to be very insular.~
@153  = ~It wasn't my idea. Trust me.~
@154  = ~My foster father was slain before my eyes. I intend to bring his killers to justice.~
@155  = ~Here's the short version: my foster father was murdered, people are after me, and it seems to be tied into the bandit plague. Don't ask me why, because I have no idea.~
@156  = ~No offense, but I don't like to talk about it.~
@157  = ~Alright, I didn't mean to pry.~
@158  = ~I didn't think it was. What kind of idiot chooses this lifestyle? If you don't want to talk about it, though, I understand.~
@159  = ~My foster father was murdered. That's what got all this started, and why I'm moving forwards.~
@160  = ~I'd prefer not to talk about it.~
@161  = ~I... I'm so sorry, <CHARNAME>. I had no idea...~
@162  = ~Don't be sorry for me. A pity party won't bring his killers to justice.~
@163  = ~Thank you, but moping won't do any good. We must press on.~
@164  = ~I don't need you to pity me, only to obey me.~
@165  = ~Enough introspection for one day, I think. Let's get moving.~
@166  = ~True. Thank you for telling me, at least.~
@167  = ~Mourning the death of a good man isn't a sign of weakness, <CHARNAME>, but I guess you're right.~
@168  = ~Very well, oh supreme leader.~
@169  = ~As you wish.~
@170  = ~(Valerie's eyes bulge) Uh. Wow. Okay. I'll, uh, need to think about this. I think.~

/* --------------------------- *
 *  Valerie Friendship Talk 3  *

@171  = ~I must admit I'm envious of your chance to actually live at Candlekeep. It sounds like an amazing place.~
@172  = ~If you like books, lots and lots of books, I suppose it is.~
@173  = ~To visit, maybe. Not much fun to grow up in, though.~
@174  = ~If you say so. I always found it terminally boring.~
@175  = ~Could you please start minding your own business and not mine?~
@176  = ~Good grief. Fine. I won't try to get to know the would-be champion of the Sword Coast, then.~
@177  = ~I love books. I think my bookshelves take up more of my room's space and more of my salary than my lab equipment, back in Athkatla. I've always hoped to visit Candlekeep someday.~
@178  = ~I never did have books of my own. Every book in Candlekeep belongs to the library.~
@179  = ~You might not enjoy it that much. Ulraunt always frowned on adding "books that lack instructional value."~
@180  = ~Do you ever read just for fun, or is it always business with you?~
@181  = ~Suit yourself. I never cared much for reading, so Candlekeep was pretty boring for me.~
@182  = ~And it's hard to start a collection on the road, I guess. Maybe we should save our gold for a bag of holding or a portable hole. Well, a girl can dream, at any rate.~
@183  = ~A bit out of our reach at the moment, yes. Dream all you like, but for now I'd settle for a nice enchanted weapon or suit of armor.~
@184  = ~Again, you're certain you're not a follower of Deneir?~
@185  = ~Dreams aren't bad, Valerie. Yours happens to be a library. Nothing wrong with that.~
@186  = ~Saving up for a bag of holding is a good idea, but I think I'd like to use it for something more practical than storing books.~
@187  = ~I can't help you on that one, <CHARNAME>. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@188  = ~I notice you don't seem to miss your family.~
@189  = ~Strange. I've heard stories that the Cowled Wizards are corrupt and prone to being, well, evil.~
@190  = ~Do you regret coming up to the Sword Coast?~
@191  = ~Sounds nice, but I think we've lost enough time already.~
@192  = ~Just because I like books and reading doesn't mean I worship them. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@193  = ~That's sweet of you to say, <CHARNAME>. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@194  = ~True, true. A bag of holding is an overburdened adventurer's best friend. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@195  = ~Ulraunt sounds like a true Oghmanyte. I don't think I agree, though. If you have fun reading a book, then that book's done a good thing, I think.~
@196  = ~You find reading fun? I should have known.~
@197  = ~Be serious, Valerie. What does a trashy romance have to offer history?~
@198  = ~I agree. Not everyone wants to learn all the time~
@199  = ~You're getting preachy again, aren't you?~
@200  = ~It took you this long to figure out that I enjoy reading? Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@201  = ~Uh, not everyone sneers at trashy romance. They're harmless fun. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@202  = ~There is a time for learning, of course, but sometimes I just want to curl up with a fun book. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@203  = ~Sorry. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@204  = ~Both? Sometimes I feel like reading a treatise on the relationship between the chromatic spells and the colors of light revealed through a glass prism, sometimes I like reading a romance story.~
@205  = ~Okay, fair enough.~
@206  = ~You actually like romance stories?~
@207  = ~The books in Candlekeep taught me a word in some obscure language I'd never heard of for what you are, Valerie. That word is "nerd."~
@208  = ~Somehow, I have no trouble taking your word for all of that.~
@209  = ~Thanks. I was, uh, expecting a more sarcastic response than that. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@210  = ~I suppose I'm a bit of a romantic at heart. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@211  = ~Not a word I'm familiar with, certainly. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@212  = ~I've never been a very good liar. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@213  = ~Each to their own, I suppose. Sigh... life was pretty good in Athkatla. Free room in the dormitory, ready access to books and lab equipment. The Cowled Wizards look after their own pretty well.~
@214  = ~Well, the Cowled Wizards took me from my family when I was six, when I first cast a spell on accident, and apprentices don't really have time for family. They're still alive, but I haven't spoken to them in years.~
@215  = ~It sounds like a terrible thing to do to a child, honestly.~
@216  = ~You don't resent the Cowled Wizards?~
@217  = ~I'd heard the Cowled Wizards weren't very nice to the Amnish people. I guess that's one story that's true.~
@218  = ~The Cowled Wizards aren't evil. We can be harsh when enforcing the law, I'll grant you, but you haven't seen what magic can do in wrong or irresponsible hands. And I suppose that when we do our jobs right, you never hear about us at all.~
@219  = ~Is magic really so dangerous? You're a sorceress, after all. Magic is in your blood.~
@220  = ~They sound like terrible people, honestly.~
@221  = ~You seem big on justice. I'm surprised you don't resent what the Cowled Wizards have done.~
@222  = ~Why would I resent them? Mages can quite literally kill with a word. I shudder to think of what might have happened if I was left to my own devices.~
@223  = ~I'm surprised to hear you say that. I thought you loved magic, but you like the people restricting its use?~
@224  = ~I don't know. You make the Cowled Wizards sound like terrible people.~
@225  = ~The stories you're telling certainly are different from the ones I've heard. "Tyrants" and "power-mongers" are words I've heard used to describe your group.~
@226  = ~Aside from the fact that my mother hates me and always has? I haven't had any reason to. Let's get going, <CHARNAME>. We've wasted enough time.~
@227  = ~I can kill people by waving my hands, reciting some words, and focusing my will. If that doesn't make me dangerous, I don't know what will. Still, we've wasted enough time. Let's get going.~
@228  = ~There are bad people in the Cowled Wizards, yes. There are good people, too. Same as any other group of people. Let's get going, <CHARNAME>.~
@229  = ~Not at all. All this exercise has been good for my body if nothing else. Well, we've spent enough time standing around here. Let's get going.~

@230  = ~I'm not sure what to make of the Sword Coast. It's so... unorganized. Baldur's Gate doesn't even have an army, just mercenaries on permanent hire.~
@231  = ~Is Amn so different? I hadn't heard much about Amn outside Athkatla.~
@232  = ~Do I hear homesickness in your voice?~
@233  = ~You get used to it. I like the Sword Coast as it is.~
@234  = ~Sorry, Valerie, but I'm not in the mood to talk.~
@235  = ~Athkatla is only the biggest city and the capital. Amn has plenty of towns and villages, there's just rarely much reason for you to hear about them up here outside crises like Nashkel.~
@236  = ~What's life like in Amn?~
@237  = ~Do you like what you've seen of the Sword Coast?~
@238  = ~Where in Amn are you from?~
@239  = ~Looks like I have a guide should we end up traveling to Amn.~
@240  = ~Guess that's the cue to get going. Plenty of things to do here on the Sword Coast.~
@241  = ~I suppose you do. It's funny, now that I think about it. Athkatla is corrupt, messy, and often unsafe if you go to the wrong part of the city, but it's home. Certainly never a lack of evil to investigate.~
@242  = ~Is that really what life in Amn is like?~
@243  = ~I hope you like what you've seen of the Sword Coast, at least.~
@244  = ~So you're from Athkatla? Doesn't sound like a safe place to grow up.~
@245  = ~I'll be sure to ask you to show me around should I end up traveling to Amn.~
@246  = ~I'm not sure that I do. Athkatla may be corrupt, but most parts of the city and other Amnish communities are safe and orderly. Here, though? I thought assassins waiting for you to arrive in the inn were just a typical bard's exaggeration.~

@248  = ~Assassins aside, how are you liking the Sword Coast?~
@249  = ~Most parts? Are you from Athkatla?~
@250  = ~You'll have to show me around, should we end up in Amn.~
@251  = ~Mostly like life here, save that there's one cohesive government and use of magic is regulated by the Cowled Wizards. I'd say it's safer and more organized than the Sword Coast.~
@252  = ~So are you going to arrest us if we cast magic in Amn?~
@253  = ~Why regulate magic?~
@254  = ~Sounds more oppressive than anything.~
@255  = ~I see. Thank you, but it's time we got going.~
@256  = ~Well, money always does speak louder than words in Amn. I'm very happy that the Cowled Wizards stay out of politics, though. We have a specific purpose: control the use of magic in Amn and protect our people from magical threats.~
@257  = ~I don't see any reason why not, should we end up there. Doesn't seem likely in the foreseeable future, though, so I suppose we should get back to the road.~
@258  = ~I think either Baldur's Gate needs to annex the Sword Coast or Amn does. In Amn, there's one cohesive government and use of magic is regulated by the Cowled Wizards. I'd say the Sword Coast would be safer with a similar model.~
@259  = ~Athkatla, Amn's capital city. In Amn, there's one cohesive government and use of magic is regulated by the Cowled Wizards. I'd say the Sword Coast would be safer with a similar model.~
@260  = ~The areas under Cowled Wizard supervision, where I grew up with my fellow apprentices, are probably the safest in Athkatla. In Amn, there's one cohesive government and use of magic is regulated by the Cowled Wizards. I'd say the Sword Coast would be safer with a similar model.~
@261  = ~Oh, spellcasting is only illegal for unlicensed mages in Athkatla itself. Even then, it wouldn't be me. We have a special group for that. But I don't think we're likely to visit Amn anytime soon, so I think it's time we got moving again.~
@262  = ~Because it's very, very dangerous? Wait. Stop it, Valerie. You're about to get preachy again. Um, can we get going before I forget how to shut up?~
@263  = ~Our purpose is to protect the people of Amn from the dangers of magic, just as the army's purpose is to protect the people of Amn from more mundane dangers. Protectors, not oppressors. Um. Can we get going before I really start preaching?~

@264  = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't meant to pry, but are you feeling alright? I've noticed you have unusual... powers, that I don't think you had when we met.~
@265  = ~Ever since leaving Candlekeep, I've been plagued by nightmares. Strange ones. Now every fresh nightmare seems to herald a new gift.~
@266  = ~I'm fine. No worse than usual, at any rate.~
@267  = ~No, I didn't have them when we met. They've been coming to me, and it worries me.~
@268  = ~I appreciate the thought, but if you don't mind, I'd rather not talk about it.~
@269  = ~It's none of your business.~
@270  = ~I see. They don't seem to be like my powers. I certainly don't have nightmares about them. Hmmm... I want to say it sounds like a magical illness of some kind, but...~
@271  = ~But what?~
@272  = ~You have an idea, I take it?~
@273  = ~Illness? That's what this feels like alright.~
@274  = ~What have we encountered that might have done something like that, though?~
@275  = ~I'm trying to think what might have done this to you. If it happened right after you left Candlekeep... hadn't encountered anything really interesting yet. Could have been a curse, I suppose...~
@276  = ~What kind of curse would give me powers? They're useful, though I could do without the nightmares.~
@277  = ~You think we should ask a priest next time we're at a temple?~
@278  = ~Don't worry too much about it. I can handle this.~
@279  = ~No, and that troubles me. It doesn't sound like you'd encountered anything really interesting yet when this started. Could have been a curse rather than an illness, I suppose...~
@280  = ~Problem is, what could have caused it? I don't think you'd encountered anything really interesting by the time this started. Could have been a curse rather than an illness, I suppose...~
@281  = ~I don't know, particularly given when this apparently started. Could have been a curse rather than an illness, I suppose...~
@282  = ~I don't know the answer to that, either. I'll start studying this in my down time, if you don't mind. If there's something wrong, we need to stop it.~
@283  = ~Couldn't hurt, I suppose, but I'll start looking into this, myself. Especially if this spreads to the rest of us, we need to know what's going on and how to stop it.~
@284  = ~I suppose we don't have much choice for the moment. Still, I'll start studying this in my down time. If there's something wrong, we need to stop it.~
@285  = ~Are you sure? I'd hardly be discouraged if our brave leader isn't well.~
@286  = ~I'm sure. Let's get back to the road.~
@287  = ~The truth is, ever since leaving Candlekeep I've been plagued by strange nightmares. Now, their wake brings new powers.~
@288  = ~Okay, I admit that I'm worried. These powers are a new and ongoing development. I don't know where they come from.~
@289  = ~It's none of your business, Valerie.~
@290  = ~If you say so...~
@291  = ~I don't blame you for being worried. In fact, you've got me worried, too. Don't know if I've heard of nightmares heralding new magical powers before. Hmmm... I want to say it sounds like a magical illness of some kind, but...~
@292  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm asking you as a colleague and as a friend. Is there something wrong?~
@293  = ~I said no and I meant it.~
@294  = ~*sigh* Very well. Short version is that I've started having nightmares since Gorion's death, and now they seem to bring new powers with them.~
@295  = ~Fine. Yes, I'm developing new powers. No, I don't know why. Yes, I'm worried. Happy now?~
@296  = ~I'm pretty sure you're lying to my face, but have it your way.~

@297  = ~<CHARNAME>, I've been studying what I know of your, ah, condition, but I'm afraid I haven't come up with anything. Silly me didn't bring many books with me, and books on this sort of thing are hard to find.~
@298  = ~The thought is appreciated anyway, Valerie.~
@299  = ~I didn't ask you to do this. Don't worry about it.~
@300  = ~If nothing else, you've ruled out a lot of causes.~
@301  = ~As I recall, I told you I didn't want to talk about this.~
@302  = ~It's no trouble. I like to think we're friends by now, and I'm happy to help. It's a nice change from destroying people with magic.~
@303  = ~Thank you for trying. I'll let you know if I learn anything else.~
@304  = ~You're good at destroying people with magic, I'm afraid.~
@305  = ~You don't win every time. Thanks anyhow.~
@306  = ~Don't you want to be more than friends, though?~
@307  = ~And I'll keep an eye out. I'm starting to think we need to visit Candlekeep or the Cowled Wizard archives, though. Maybe in the future.~
@308  = ~Not my favorite part of being a sorceress. Helping people, good. Destroying evil, good. Destroying *people*... let's get going.~
@309  = ~You're welcome. I'm starting to think we need to visit Candlekeep or the Cowled Wizard archives, though. Maybe in the future.~
@310  = ~I'm flattered, <CHARNAME>. But, well, you're not my type. My, ah, preferences lie elsewhere.~
@311  = ~I'm flattered, <CHARNAME>. I really am. You're beautiful and brave and I'm pretty sure you've saved my life at least once. I should be falling head over heels for you. But... I'm not ready. Maybe someday, but not now. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@312  = ~I think we're friends, <CHARNAME>. I am going to worry about my friends when they get spooky powers out of nowhere. Unfortunately, I have no results for you. It's like nothing I've ever heard of.~
@313  = ~True enough. Wish I could have done more, but I couldn't have done even that much without you. You've been a good friend, <CHARNAME>.~
@314  = ~Your magical abilities have been a great help, especially the combat-related ones.~
@315  = ~You did. But because I consider you a friend, I ignored you, learned what I could, and studied what I could.~
@316  = ~Valerie, when I tell you I don't want to talk about something, I don't want to talk about it.~
@317  = ~Do you want me to not trust you again or something? You went behind my back.~
@318  = ~How clear do I have to make it when I don't want you looking into something?~
@319  = ~Alright, it probably was for the best. Thanks anyway.~
@320  = ~You've been keeping secrets that could put us all in danger. I'll back off for now, <CHARNAME>, but don't count on me standing idly by while you sit on a delayed blast fireball.~
@321  = ~You can trust me if I can trust you. <CHARNAME>, keeping secrets can put everyone in danger. This one may or may not be harmful. We don't know and neither do you. Consider that before you play god.~
@322  = ~You can tell me to leave next time you want to sit on secrets that may or may not put us all in danger. We don't know what's happening to you. Consider how bad it could be before you tell me to stop worrying.~

@323  = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't mean to seem egocentric, but I've been thinking about your powers and my own magic. Something's occurred to me.~
@324  = ~Witches, warlocks, and sorcerers are, by and large, different names for the same phenomenon - people born with innate magical abilities. Humans, as a general rule, are not magical creatures. Humans with innate magical powers, as opposed to learned like wizards and clerics, are justly seen as unnatural.~
@325  = ~Witches, warlocks, and sorcerers are, by and large, different names for the same phenomenon - people born with innate magical abilities. Humans, as a general rule, are not magical creatures. Elves often are, but your powers don't match anything I've read of elven innate magic.~
@326  = ~Witches, warlocks, and sorcerers are, by and large, different names for the same phenomenon - people born with innate magical abilities. Humans, as a general rule, are not magical creatures, and this goes double for dwarves. A dwarf with innate magical powers goes a long way past unusual and straight into unnatural.~
@327  = ~Witches, warlocks, and sorcerers are, by and large, different names for the same phenomenon - people born with innate magical abilities. Humans, as a general rule, are not magical creatures. Gnomes are, but their powers very strongly favor illusions and divination. Yours are not, and verge on the unnatural for a gnome.~
@328  = ~Witches, warlocks, and sorcerers are, by and large, different names for the same phenomenon - people born with innate magical abilities. Humans, as a general rule, are not magical creatures, and neither are halflings.  Humans and halflings with innate magical powers are justly seen as unnatural.~
@329  = ~Witches, warlocks, and sorcerers are, by and large, different names for the same phenomenon - people born with innate magical abilities. Humans, orcs, and crossbreeds thereof are, as a general rule, not magical creatures. A half-orc with innate magical powers is, well, less unusual than downright unnatural.~
@330  = ~You're building up to something, aren't you?~
@331  = ~Unnatural? What do you mean by that?~
@332  = ~I don't know about unnatural. These powers resemble those my faith grants me.~
@333  = ~I definitely didn't study these abilities, but they are magical.~
@334  = ~You may have a point. I'm not exactly a spell-slinging mage.~
@335  = ~I know all of this. I'm a sorcerer, same as you, remember?~
@336  = ~I don't like where this is going. Quit while you're ahead, Valerie.~
@337  = ~If that's what you want.~
@338  = ~Okay, here's the short version. Your developing powers don't match a magical illness. They do match a sorcerer or warlock coming into their powers. Everything you've told me matches up.~
@339  = ~How is that possible?~
@340  = ~You really think I'm a sorcerer?~
@341  = ~Well, I guess that makes sense.~
@342  = ~I already am a sorcerer. These powers aren't like my magic. They're something different.~
@343  = ~That's... Well, shoot. Hypothesis busted. Back to the drawing board, then.~
@344  = ~Same way my powers are, most likely. One of your ancestors was a non-<PRO_RACE> critter of some sort, with innate magical abilities that it passed down to its descendants. All in all, good news.~
@345  = ~Think, yes, but I grant you that the conclusions of a very junior Cowled Wizard aren't exactly gospel. Doesn't hurt to keep the book open, should more evidence present itself.~
@346  = ~I agree. Could have been a lot worse.~
@347  = ~That it is something not normally found in nature. Your developing powers don't match a magical illness. They do match a sorcerer or warlock coming into their powers. Interesting to see it from the outside.~
@348  = ~True, but you don't pray to your god for them. I think. Hmmm. You are right, though. I wonder... no, that's just a dumb idea. Well, you've raised a good point, <CHARNAME>. I'll think about it.~
@349  = ~Precisely. You may have studied magic in a more organized fashion, but everything you've described matches a sorcerer or warlock coming into their powers. Interesting to see it from the outside.~
@350  = ~I know. Everything you've described matches a sorcerer or warlock coming into their powers. Interesting to see it from the outside.~
@351  = ~Uh. I kind of forgot about that. Everything you've described matches a sorcerer or warlock coming into their powers, but you've already come into yours, so... maybe you're both?~
@352  = ~You really think I'm a warlock as well?~
@353  = ~I already am a sorcerer, and I know what magic feels like. These powers aren't like my magic. They're something different.~

@356  = ~I appreciate the thought anyway.~
@357  = ~I don't mind you wanting to help, but could you please ask permission next time and listen to my answer?~

@365  = ~It's odd to think how it really wasn't that long ago that I was told to join the army detachment heading for Nashkel. This adventuring gig does mess with your perception of time.~
@366  = ~That it does.~
@367  = ~Well, you *have* been with me for a while. Check your calendar.~
@368  = ~This isn't a life for the timid, that's for certain. Good thing I'm not. Not anymore, at any rate.~

@371  = ~Yeah, yeah. We can do plenty of reminiscing later.~
@372  = ~Fair enough.~

@380  = ~You aren't about to turn into a shrieking fangirl, are you?~
@381  = ~I'll grant you that it didn't look like there was much to do in Nashkel besides listen to bards.~
@382  = ~I can give you a more personal account, if you wish...~
@383  = ~Not exactly. Honestly, heroism doesn't seem to be all it's said to be. More often, it's dirty, bloody, and painful.~
@384  = ~If I ever do, you have my permission to put me out of my misery, <CHARNAME>. It would be a mercy to avoid becoming one of those squealing maidens who throw themselves at adventurers. Ugh.~
@385  = ~Too true, especially for a mage. Not many people to talk to in Nashkel, and most of them were soldiers or miners. Well, there was also that Rashemar berserker. And Noober. Just about anything is a welcome change of pace after that.~
@386  = ~No. I don't know what Sword Coast girls are like, but we try to have standards in Amn. Go hire a whore next time we're in town if you really need to satisfy yourself.~
@387  = ~No. There is work yet to be done. Still, I have to wonder if I'll recognize myself in the mirror after this. In war, you find yourself... or find yourself wanting. Torm may not see eye to eye with Tempus on many things, but that's a proverb in both churches.~
@388  = ~So have you found yourself?~
@389  = ~This isn't a war, Valerie.~
@390  = ~There's truth to that proverb. I don't think I could have found myself within the walls of Candlekeep.~
@391  = ~Let me know if you find me. I'm still looking.~
@392  = ~Maybe. Pain, suffering, evil... academic concepts until recently. They say evil prevails when good fails to act. I don't know if I'm *good* good, but I can't sit back and not act anymore. Thanks for talking with me, <CHARNAME>.~
@393  = ~Isn't it? People are dying. For whatever reason, people on both sides are willing to die for their cause. That sounds like a war to me. It's a sobering thought. I'd better go to bed before I continue this line of thinking.~
@394  = ~A metaphor right out of my class on rhetoric. Or maybe you were being literal. Good for you either, way, I suppose. I think I have more searching yet to do.~
@395  = ~Hah. I do think the saying was meant as a metaphor for an inward journey, <CHARNAME>.~
@396  = ~I'll keep an eye out. You're, ah, hard to miss.~
@397  = ~You do look like you've aged a few years in much less than that. You haven't chosen a life calculated to preserve your youth.~
@398  = ~Maybe, but I like this life just fine.~
@399  = ~This life chose me, not the other way around.~
@400  = ~I intend to leave this life behind as soon as I can.~
@401  = ~A lot of things are better when aged. If it works for wine and cheese, why not me?~
@402  = ~I wasn't trying to dissuade you, but I don't know if it's the life for me. Still, I'm happy you're enjoying yourself.~
@403  = ~True. Fate dealt you a lousy hand, <CHARNAME>, and to be honest I'm kinda glad I'm not in your position. Guess we all have to play the cards we're dealt, though.~
@404  = ~I can relate, I think. Still, Amn and the Sword Coast need you still. For good or ill, you're the best bet we all have of stopping this war before it begins.~
@405  = ~That's... a novel way of putting it. Aged wine is good, but old beer isn't. I suppose we'll see whether you're a fine chardonnay or just old stout.~
@406  = ~Please excuse me while I extract my foot from my mouth. Looks like I should just stop talking. I'm clearly not thinking straight.~

@425  = ~I'm tired of this labyrinthine plot, <CHARNAME>. I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of killing. I don't want to think about all the blood on my hands, or what the inevitable next complication will be. So... wine helps me not think.~

@432  = ~I hate to break it to you, but if you're with me you're by definition a heroic adventurer. Depending on your definition of heroic.~
@433  = ~Think about how many lives are depending on us, and on you. Are you really going to let them down by drinking yourself into a stupor?~
@434  = ~Fate rarely calls us at a moment of our choosing, I'm afraid. You can handle this, even if you don't think you can.~

@443  = ~Heh. The bad guys have Cyric and probably Iyachtu Xvim and who knows what else. We have Torm and... whoever it is you and the others worship. I guess we should try to avoid a new Time of Troubles, though. Thanks for the talk, <CHARNAME>.~
@444  = ~You know, you had me going with the therapy until you said that. Still, point taken. I'll pay my tab and go to bed. Who knows, maybe I'll even get to sleep in for once.~
@445  = ~Before the Time of Troubles, I'm told, the church of Torm fell under the sway of an evil priest who bent the Tormtar towards prosecuting believers of all other gods as heretics and blasphemers. More or less the entire church fell under his corrupt tongue.~
@446  = ~As the Time of Troubles began, Torm himself personally stepped in and revealed the corruption of the church. Then came Torm's battle with Bane, where both fell, and Torm was subsequently reborn and restored because he died acting in his own portfolio - obeying orders.~

@458  = ~Good point. Come to think of it, I haven't seen a beautiful, mysterious girl who turns out to be a princess yet. I'm pretty sure you're not one. Any ideas on where my mandatory princess and girlfriend must be hiding?~
@459  = ~Not into princesses. Assuming the bards will forgive this plot twist, you have any leads on a handsome prince for me?~
@460  = ~...Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I really do appreciate it. Let me pay my tab and I'll go to bed.~
@461  = ~Hah! Point taken. But would you *please* make sure that last one doesn't come up much? Resurrection doesn't make *dying* any less painful...~
@462  = ~Hahaha! Okay, okay. I don't want to be the hero. You get the angst and the torrid love scenes and the horrible secrets from your past. The stage is back to you, my friend.~
@463  = ~Hmm...~
@464  = ~Well... there's Imoen. Mysterious background like yours, very pretty, but she's basically your sister, so let's not go there...~
@465  = ~Jaheira's a noblewoman and elfy to boot. But she's married and probably twice your age, so if she was your princess that would just be creepy...~
@466  = ~Dynaheir, maybe? She certainly acts like a princess, and she's very pretty. I say go for it, but let's see...~
@467  = ~I keep thinking Xan's a girl out of the corner of my eye, but I suppose I'll be fair to the elves and not say anything more...~
@468  = ~Shar-Teel, maybe? That would be something... special...~
@469  = ~Does a warrior woman whom I wouldn't put it past to be some barbarian chieftain's daughter count? I won't say anything about this to Branwen if you won't...~
@470  = ~Do halflings have princesses? If they do, I sure as Torm hope Alora isn't an example...~
@471  = ~Skie's close enough to a princess for Sword Coast purposes. If you want my help permanently removing Eldoth from the equation, I'm willing to hear you out...~
@472  = ~There's always Viconia for your undoubtedly kinky and possibly abusive princess if you think this is a comedy rather than a drama...~
@473  = ~Would be a heck of a twist if Faldorn was a princess. Not sure you'd survive the honeymoon, though...~
@474  = ~Safana's possible, I guess, but I'd be careful on the honeymoon. You don't know where it's been...~
@475  = ~Well, maybe you'll have better luck adventuring someplace with an actual monarchy. Aren't oligarchies like Baldur's Gate and Amn grand? I'll leave you to your princess-searching, <CHARNAME>. Good night.~
@476  = ~In a word, Ajantis. Tall, built like a battering ram, so selflessly noble it hurts, and he might as well be a prince...~
@477  = ~Wait, Branwen isn't a man despite acting, smelling, and kind of looking like one, nevermind...~
@478  = ~If you're into elves, lucky we have Coran around and not a teenage boy, and for all we know he might indeed be a prince...~
@479  = ~Edwin's good-looking, I guess, and I suppose SOMEONE has to find him attractive rather than obnoxious...~
@480  = ~If you're desperate, there's Eldoth, but I wouldn't wish him on my worst enemy...~
@481  = ~Garrick's nice. He's not my type, but he certainly fits the prince either unknowing or deliberately masquerading as a commoner...~
@482  = ~I know dwarves have kings and princesses, but Kagain is, well, old, so...~
@483  = ~Is Khalid a prince, or just a noble? Either way though, he *is* married to one of the more intimidating women I've ever met, so good luck with that one...~
@484  = ~Angst McRevenge, erm, Kivan could well be a prince, but I'd wait until he's gotten over his wife's death first...~
@485  = ~I don't think Rasheman has princes, but if you like Minsc I won't say anything...~
@486  = ~Montaron. No. Hmmm...~
@487  = ~I suppose someone in this wide world must consider Quayle a dashing prince. No idea who that someone is, though...~
@488  = ~Yeah, no, I'm not going to talk about Tiax...~
@489  = ~I suppose Xan really is a man. Could have fooled me. And I think he genuinely is a prince... or an elf. Tough call...~
@490  = ~Let's just say Xzar exists and move on, shall we?~
@491  = ~If you like dwarves, I wonder if Yeslick qualifies as a prince of his clan...~
@492  = ~Well, maybe you'll have better luck adventuring someplace with an actual monarchy. Aren't oligarchies like Baldur's Gate and Amn grand? I'll leave you to your prince-searching, <CHARNAME>. Good night.~
@493  = ~Don't remind me, <CHARNAME>. I know, I know. You're the plucky heroine of humble origin who assembles an unlikely group of companions and goes off to slay dragons and... huh. I don't recall any actual stories about heroic women. Find a handsome prince, maybe? Guess I have to get used to my place in history as your henchwoman.~
@494  = ~Good point. Come to think of it, I haven't seen a handsome, noble young man who turns out to be a prince yet. I'm pretty sure you're not one. Any ideas on where my mandatory prince and boyfriend must be hiding?~
@495  = ~Not into princes. Assuming the bards will forgive this plot twist, you have any leads on a beautiful princess for me?~
@496  = ~Uh, was that supposed to make me feel better?~
@497  = ~No.~
@498  = ~It was supposed to remind you why you joined up with me in the first place.~
@499  = ~You're Tormish, right? Isn't this a dereliction of your duty?~
@500  = ~Everyone is depending on us. My home, your home, everyone's. Are you really going to just sit there, drink, and fall apart?~
@501  = ~Not beating around the bush tonight, are you? Sigh. Fine. I'll pay my tab and go to bed. Now go away before I change my mind about not lying.~
@502  = ~(Valerie stares at her drink for several seconds before answering) You're right. Damn it. Fine. I'll pay my tab and go to bed. Happy now, father?~
@503  = ~(Valerie stares at her drink for several seconds before answering) You're right. Damn it. Fine. I'll pay my tab and go to bed. Happy now, mother?~
@504  = ~Torm recognizes the concept of downtime. Fine. If it will get you off my back, I'll pay my tab and go to bed.~
@505  = ~Great. I'm getting lectured by someone maybe two years my elder. Father, do I have permission to pay my bar tab and go to bed now? Before you answer... shut up.~
@506  = ~Great. I'm getting lectured by someone maybe two years my elder. Mother, do I have permission to pay my bar tab and go to bed now? Before you answer... shut up.~
@507  = ~Wheeeee. I haven't heard this sermon since the last service at the temple of Torm in Athkatla when a new paladin was being inducted.~
@508  = ~(Clear your voice) On the day of Shieldmeet, many moons ago, the young hero stepped forth. He felt himself unready, yet his heart was pure...~
@509  = ~I notice you're not saying the point isn't true.~
@510  = ~You're not doing the Loyal Fury much credit at the moment, you know.~
@511  = ~Fine. You stop drinking, I stop preaching.~
@512  = ~Going to bed. Now.~
@513  = ~Fine. Convinced. Job done. Let me pay my tab and I'll go to bed.~
@514  = ~Hmmm. Theological discussion or getting away from you for the night... paying my tab and going to bed sounds like an excellent idea.~
@515  = ~Sigh. Deal. Let me pay my tab and I'll go to bed.~
@516  = ~I *am* dealing with it, you ass. I didn't ask for your opinion or invite you to join me.~
@517  = ~Don't care. Go to bed, Valerie. Now.~
@518  = ~And I didn't ask for your opinion, either. Stop drinking and deal with this in a way that doesn't involve self-destruction.~
@519  = ~What about tomorrow night? And the night after? It feels good now, but you're setting yourself up for a hard fall, Valerie.~
@520  = ~(Wave the bartender over) My friend has already had too much to drink tonight. How much is her tab?~
@521  = ~Fine. The tab's yours to pay, then.~
@522  = ~Damn it. I was hoping you were just being an ass, not an ass with a point. Fine. I'll pay my tab and go to bed. Happy now?~
@523  = ~...Paying my tab and going to bed now.~
@524  = ~I don't need you to take care of me, <CHARNAME>. I can pay my own tab and go to bed, thank you very much. Ass.~
@525  = ~In a word, no. That is all I am going to say on that subject.~
@526  = ~I understand. It was just a thought.~
@527  = ~What's your objection to it? You can afford a good one on an adventurer's pay.~
@528  = ~What's the matter, have someone special back home in Amn?~
@529  = ~What about me, then?~
@530  = ~A vile and unwelcome one. Let me pay my tab first and I'll go to bed. Alone.~
@531  = ~It is a vile profession in which very few ever voluntarily work. I will not condone it, much less partake of it. End of discussion. Good night.~
@532  = ~I don't need someone special to object to prostitution on moral grounds. I'm disappointed that you do. Good night.~
@533  = ~Since you're being so forward tonight, I will be, too. I am not attracted to men. You are not an exception. Good night.~
@534  = ~Since you're being so forward tonight, I will be, too. I am not attracted to gnomes. You are not an exception. Good night.~
@535  = ~Since you're being so forward tonight, I will be, too. I am not attracted to halflings. You are not an exception. Good night.~
@536  = ~Since you're being so forward tonight, I will be, too. I will only give my maidenhood to a woman I truly love and want to spend the rest of my life with. Perhaps in the future you will be that woman, but that is for another time.~
@537  = ~You've got enough on your shoulders without me coming crying to you. I will persevere. It just so happens that my perseverance requires some liquid reinforcement now and then.~
@538  = ~I understand your doubts, Valerie, but wine won't solve your problems.~
@539  = ~Look, if you're at your limits, I understand if you want to head back to Amn.~
@540  = ~Point taken. I think I could do with some liquid reinforcement, myself.~
@541  = ~I don't want to leave, <CHARNAME>. This quest of yours is important. You know it, I know it. I won't walk away from it. I do, however, reserve the right to not think about how deep this plot goes.~
@542  = ~Having trouble is one thing, Valerie, but drinking yourself to oblivion is quite another.~
@543  = ~You could have said something to me earlier, you know. There's no shame in feeling down.~
@544  = ~When you put it like that, would you mind some company at the bar?~
@545  = ~I usually drink alone, but sure. One condition, though: this is *not* going to lead to us both getting tipsy and you carrying me off to your bed.~
@546  = ~I do wonder what might have put an idea like that in your head...~
@547  = ~Don't worry. I'm a gentleman.~
@548  = ~Don't worry. I'm a lady.~
@549  = ~Already spoken for, thank you very much.~
@550  = ~Just making sure. Never do know with you scrappy adventurer sorts. Cheers, <CHARNAME>.~

@551  = ~I'm sorry about what happened the other night, <CHARNAME>. I had actually meant to ask how you were doing. I can't imagine the pressure you're under.~
@552  = ~You don't need to worry about me.~
@553  = ~I'm fine. I'm used to pressure by now.~
@554  = ~I'm doing as well enough. Not so bad that I need to, say, get drunk.~
@555  = ~It's not a life I'd wish on anyone. I'm playing the cards I was dealt, but it isn't exactly a winning hand.~
@556  = ~What do you think? I had a worse hangover than you the morning after.~
@557  = ~I appreciate the thought, but I'd prefer not to talk about it.~
@558  = ~Are you sure? I know I haven't always been the best listener, but I'm willing to talk or listen if you need to get something off your chest.~
@559  = ~You worry too much. Stop fretting.~
@560  = ~I'm doing fine, really. It's not as bad as you seem to think.~
@561  = ~Well, I'm managing. It's tough, but I'm dealing with it.~
@562  = ~It's bad, alright? Everything that can go wrong has.~
@563  = ~Last time we talked, I got drunk off my arse. Does that answer your question?~
@564  = ~Please, Valerie. Stop poking.~
@565  = ~Well, alright. Just remember that you aren't alone, <CHARNAME>.~
@566  = ~Okay, I'll let a delayed blast fireball lie. Still, if you change your mind...~
@567  = ~Look to your own problems, Valerie, and stop worry about me.~
@568  = ~I'm doing fine, all things considered. I can handle the pressure.~
@569  = ~I'm doing better than I'd feared, worse than I'd hoped. It's a living.~
@570  = ~I thought I told you how I was doing when we got drunk last time.~
@571  = ~Not well, honestly. The road is not a pleasant life.~
@572  = ~Valerie. Delayed blast fireball. Boom.~
@573  = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. If you ever change your mind, though, I'll be here.~
@574  = ~Wow. No wonder you're the one everyone's talking about. The world keeps taking its best shot, but you come up grinning. Still, if you ever need to talk, I'm here.~
@575  = ~Well, there is something I did want a second opinion on...~
@576  = ~I'll bear that in mind. For now, let's get moving.~
@577  = ~...I'm not sure I would have done the same in your position, but it seems to be working out so far. If you want to use me as a sounding board in the future, you know where to find me.~
@578  = ~Sure thing.~
@579  = ~I never did buy into those stories that you're an invincible juggernaut, <CHARNAME>. If you want to talk, get something off your chest, I'll always be here to listen.~
@580  = ~There is this matter that's been bothering me...~
@581  = ~Maybe later, but we need to get moving.~
@582  = ~...And I'm sure you did the best you could. Thank you for opening up, and I'm happy to talk anytime you need a friendly ear.~
@583  = ~Anytime.~
@584  = ~Ah... that. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I didn't mean to drag you into my bad habits. If you want to talk, though, without the wine, I'll be happy to.~
@585  = ~It can't hurt. So, a while back...~
@586  = ~Not right now, at least. Let's get going.~
@587  = ~...Would that everything went as well as the stories. Not to repeat myself too much, but I'm sorry and I'm here anytime you need to talk.~
@588  = ~(Valerie places her hand on your shoulder) Life may be hard, <CHARNAME>, but you aren't alone here. Any time you need to talk, I'm here.~
@589  = ~Well, if you have time, there is something I want to talk about...~
@590  = ~I appreciate the thought. For now, though, we need to get going.~
@591  = ~...Life isn't always fair, is it? I guess there's nothing to do but endure and carry on. I'm here for you, <CHARNAME>, whenever you need me.~

@593  = ~<CHARNAME>, if you've got a few minutes, I'd like your help with something. Don't worry, it's completely mundane and there's no wine in sight.~
@594  = ~Certainly. What's going on?~
@595  = ~Awww, but I liked the wine.~
@596  = ~Can't you get one of the others to help you with it?~
@597  = ~I'm kind of busy right now. Can it wait?~
@598  = ~I'm starting to write down everything we've done on our travels, for posterity and for telling my superiors just where I was all this time. The Nashkel mines, the bandit camps, the Cloakwood, Baldur's Gate... we've done a lot, haven't we?~
@599  = ~And what a long, strange trip it's been.~
@600  = ~Not enough, Valerie. Until the Iron Throne is stopped once and for all, we haven't done enough.~
@601  = ~They do say it's more about the journey than the destination.~
@602  = ~If you're hiding a bottle of wine in your bags, seems like a good occasion to uncork it.~
@603  = ~So are you my biographer now?~
@604  = ~It's a bad habit. Tends to get me depressed and mopey. Anyhow, I'm starting to write down all that we've done on the Sword Coast. The Nashkel mines, the bandit camps, the Cloakwood, Baldur's Gate...  it took longer than I thought to recount them.~
@605  = ~Quite a trip it's been.~
@606  = ~It's a start, but until the Iron Throne is stopped, it's only a start.~
@607  = ~What do the bards like to say... it's the journey, not the destination?~
@608  = ~This our cue to find a bottle of wine and uncork it?~
@609  = ~You're writing a biography of me now?~
@610  = ~I could, but I'd like your particular insight into this.~
@611  = ~Okay, what gives?~
@612  = ~Change your mind about no wine and we'll see.~
@613  = ~I'm busy at the moment. Can this wait?~
@614  = ~I suppose it's not important. Maybe some other time.~
@615  = ~People are toasting your name in Nashkel, Beregost, and the Friendly Arm Inn. Even Baldur's Gate and Athkatla have probably heard your name. You've probably got a baby or two named after you.~
@616  = ~What I wanted to ask you, <CHARNAME>, is why you're doing this. Is it just revenge, or something more?~
@617  = ~War between Baldur's Gate and Amn would be a terrible thing. If I can stop it, I must.~
@618  = ~This can't be just about a war. The Iron Throne's machinations run deeper than that. I intend to find out what it is about.~
@619  = ~It's about saving the Sword Coast, but I won't deny that I'm looking forward to avenging Gorion.~
@620  = ~Justice, Valerie. Not revenge.~
@621  = ~And what if it is just revenge?~
@622  = ~But why, <CHARNAME>? Why are you going to such lengths? People are talking about you from Baldur's Gate to Athkatla, and odds are <CHARNAME> is going to be a popular name in the next generation of the Sword Coast. Why are you pushing so hard and far?~
@623  = ~You know as well as I do how terrible war between Baldur's Gate and Amn would be. It cannot be permitted.~
@624  = ~I doubt this is just about a war. I have a bad feeling that this crisis has a deeper purpose, and I intend to find out what that purpose is.~
@625  = ~Saving the Sword Coast is the goal, yes, but avenging Gorion is a definite bonus.~
@626  = ~This isn't about revenge. It's about justice.~
@627  = ~What would you say if it really was as simple as avenging Gorion?~
@628  = ~Not many journeys are as hazardous to your health as this one. Or... to your mental health. <CHARNAME>, why are you doing this? Not the answer you give grateful townsfolk, but what's driving you? Revenge? Or something more?~
@629  = ~People toast your name across the Sword Coast. Athkatla's probably heard your name, and odds are you're going to be the namesake of a number of children running around the Sword Coast. What does it all mean to you, really?~
@630  = ~Too many lives would be lost in war between Baldur's Gate and Amn. I have to stop it from happening.~
@631  = ~This goes deeper than war. Too many things don't add up. I intend to find out what's *really* going on.~
@632  = ~Saving the Sword Coast, good. Saving the Sword Coast and avenging Gorion, better.~
@633  = ~This is justice, Valerie. Not vengeance.~
@634  = ~You hit the nail on the head when you mentioned revenge, I'm afraid.~
@635  = ~Nice try, though I bet people are celebrating your deeds in Nashkel, Beregost, and the Friendly Arm Inn. Baldur's Gate and Athkatla probably know your name. You're going down in the history books.~
@636  = ~Don't flatter yourself. I'm sure there's some bard who can sop your vanity if that's what you want. What I want to know is why you're doing all this. From the Nashkel mines to the bandits to the Cloakwood, you've done a lot to stabilize the region.~
@637  = ~Is it simply for revenge? For your foster father? Or something else?~
@638  = ~I'd be surprised if you didn't want revenge. Saving the land with personal vengeance along the way does sound like a good deal. Still... do you really think we can do this, <CHARNAME>?~
@639  = ~Of course. We've come too far to be stopped now.~
@640  = ~Our enemy is as clumsy as he is arrogant. He's left us a trail at every turn, and soon he'll have nowhere else to hide.~
@641  = ~Maybe, maybe not. I intend to try regardless.~
@642  = ~No, but the alternative is to lay down and die. I will make a fight of this to the end.~
@643  = ~Really? I don't mean to sound like I'm doubting you, but I'm surprised all the same. I've always wondered if heroes like Lord Keldorn Firecam were really as idealistic as the stories say. Guess they are, or some of them at any rate.~
@644  = ~What's so hard to believe about it? You don't want to stop the war?~
@645  = ~You're pretty cynical for a newly-minted Cowled Wizard.~
@646  = ~I don't deny I have selfish reasons as well, but I really do want to stop this war from happening.~
@647  = ~Okay, you got me. It sounds good, but really, I'm after something closer to home.~
@648  = ~Of course I do, but this is my first time getting acquainted with genuine heroism. Feels good, doesn't it?~
@649  = ~My fault for reading so much, I guess, and living in Athkatla breeds a cynical view of the world. Maybe I should request permanent assignment to the northlands...~
@650  = ~That's very human of you, and I don't blame you a bit. Selfishness is one thing so long as it doesn't rule you, I think.~
@651  = ~I wish I was surprised. You put on a good act, <CHARNAME>. If you had said you were in this for idealistic reasons, I would have believed you.~
@652  = ~I don't know if you're really that confident, or just stupid. No offense meant. You're the best chance anyone has of stopping this war before it starts, so I'm with you regardless.~
@653  = ~True enough. Better to try and die than to lay down and die anyway. I've wondered why Torm's proverbs are often so grim, but I think I understand now. They're meant for grim times.~
@654  = ~Well, thanks for that cheerful thought. Better to try and die than to lay down and die anyway. I've wondered why Torm's proverbs are often so grim, but I think I understand now. They're meant for grim times.~
@655  = ~An enigma wrapped in a mystery, as one of my teachers liked to say. Do you really think we can get to the bottom of this and stop it, whatever 'it' is?~
@656  = ~We've had breadcrumbs enough to lead us this far. Our enemy really isn't good at covering their tracks.~
@657  = ~Why not? We've gotten this far and are still on the trail.~
@658  = ~I don't know. But I'll be damned if I'm not going to try.~
@659  = ~It does seem unlikely. We've done the unlikely before, though.~
@660  = ~True enough. Whoever this would-be mastermind is, he's sloppy. Smart and cunning, but sloppy. Thank Torm our enemies aren't as good as they probably think they are.~
@661  = ~Hah. Trailblazing isn't exactly my thing, but I'll do what I can. We've done enough hiking through the wilds, physical and metaphorical, that perhaps I should start learning the art of pathfinding.~
@662  = ~I respect that, <CHARNAME>, and you. Go down a hero or go down swinging, Torm says there's no shame in either. Just between you and me, though, I prefer the first option.~
@663  = ~True. Maybe you should start advertising your services: <CHARNAME> and Company, doers of the unlikely, risky, and barely plausible. Impossible costs extra. Don't give me that look, it's something to do after this mess ends one way or the other.~
@664  = ~I'm not going to get into an argument about justice versus revenge with you. I know better than to think I can change your mind. Just... be careful. If stories are any indication, you're walking a dangerous precipice.~
@665  = ~Relax. The death of my father figure isn't going to turn me into some emotionally wrecked vigilante for the rest of my life.~
@666  = ~It would be revenge if it was just about Gorion, but he hasn't been the only casualty of this conflict.~
@667  = ~I'm content to let history judge me.~
@668  = ~Stop worrying. I know what I'm doing.~
@669  = ~I hope not. The moment a mask and cape come out, I'm calling it quits. No offense.~
@670  = ~True enough. And from what you've said, I doubt the man responsible for Gorion's death will just come quietly.~
@671  = ~Don't try to be a great man, just be a man. Let history make its own judgment. A proverb of Torm's, <CHARNAME>. Maybe I should pay more attention to temple services.~
@672  = ~I hope so, <CHARNAME>. I really do.~
@673  = ~Well... if it saves the Sword Coast and Amn, I guess, but I'd rather not discuss this further.~

@682  = ~Have any interesting conclusions?~

@688  = ~I don't want to be hardened by all of this. I don't want killing and suffering to become routine for me. I don't want to be unsurprised by what I learn when I study our enemy.~
@689  = ~Fine, fine. What have you learned?~
@690  = ~I thought you said you were done moping.~
@691  = ~Valerie? Now would be a good time to stop talking.~
@692  = ~Okay, okay. Shutting up now.~
@693  = ~*Sigh*. Forget I said anything.~
@694  = ~Everything we've seen so far has been cast in terms of a trade dispute between Amn and Baldur's Gate. Nothing too unusual there, but everything seems to be pushing for a military conflict, not economic. I don't have anything *conclusive*, but...~
@695  = ~So I'm not the only one studying what's happening, and I suspect my conclusions are as bleak as yours. Tell me what you've found and let's compare notes.~
@696  = ~Interesting. I have my deep suspicions as well. Tell me what you believe is happening.~
@697  = ~I get the feeling I'm not going to like what you've learned.~
@698  = ~On second thought, I don't think I want to know what you've discovered. Please, let me figure this out on my own.~
@699  = ~There's more to this than iron. I'd bet my life on it. Neither Baldur's Gate nor Amn is ready for a war. They'd both lose. Baldur's Gate has a small army of mercenaries. Too small to invade Amn in any meaningful way, even if the Citadel of Strategic Militancy near Baldur's Gate gets involved.~
@700  = ~Amn's forces are stretched thin. We're being invaded by an army of demi-humans from the south and have recurring problems with drow raiders and spillover from the Tethyrian wars. We could take this stretch of the Sword Coast, maybe, but not hold it.~
@701  = ~Peace and prosperity are good for business, <CHARNAME>. The kind of chaos a war between Baldur's Gate and Amn would unleash... There are lots of ways someone might benefit from that, none of them good.~
@702  = ~What do you think we should do?~
@703  = ~If it comes to war, what will you do?~
@704  = ~It's an interesting theory, but I'm not convinced.~
@705  = ~Unfortunately, this theory makes more sense than anything else I've heard.~
@706  = ~*sigh* I don't know, <CHARNAME>. I don't think Amn is perfect, by any stretch of the imagination, but I will fight for my home if the reason is just. In this mess... I don't know what the right thing to do is. I pray we can stop this before it reaches that point.~
@707  = ~I want to say we should run, alert the Order of the Radiant Heart, maybe the full force of the Cowled Wizards or Harpers. But... time is a luxury we don't have. We're in the right place at the right time. I pray we're the right people.~
@708  = ~What if you're right?~
@709  = ~If Baldur's Gate and Amn do go to war, what will you do?~
@710  = ~I wouldn't be so sure. Bhaal being involved is only a theory.~
@711  = ~We are. I think you're right, and I know we have to stop this.~
@712  = ~(Valerie takes a deep breath) Then we can't afford to fail. We can't. Baldur's Gate can't. Amn can't. I don't want to think about how many lives are depending on us.~
@713  = ~I don't want to believe it, either, <CHARNAME>. I'll pray I'm just being paranoid and seeing patterns where there are none.~
@714  = ~...I'm afraid, <CHARNAME>. I really am. The Iron Throne is one thing, but someone willing to start a devastating war for their own purposes... Torm, protect us and forgive my weakness. The place of the strong is between the weak and those who would prey upon them.~
@715  = ~This isn't about iron. A trade dispute wouldn't mean war, and that's exactly what everything we've seen has been pointing towards. It's just circumstantial evidence, and I hope it's only coincidence...~
@716  = ~And if it's not?~
@717  = ~I'm sure it is just coincidence.~

 *  Condition: After escaping Candlekeep  *
 * -------------------------------------- */
@718  = ~<CHARNAME>, I know you probably don't want to talk about what happened, so I'll make this fast. I believe that who you are matters much more than what you are. Child of Bhaal or no, you are <CHARNAME> first and foremost.~
@719  = ~I doubt it's as easy as that, but thank you for the support.~
@720  = ~How can you say that, Valerie? My father was the god of murder.~
@721  = ~Maybe, but I am intrigued by the gifts I've developed. What other powers might I wield, I wonder?~
@722  = ~Valerie, I'd really prefer not to talk about this.~
@723  = ~I understand. Let's go, then.~
@724  = ~Any time you need me, my friend, I'm here.~
@725  = ~Mind if I unload on you some? I really need to talk to someone, anyone, about this mess.~
@726  = ~*Any* time?~
@727  = ~And I appreciate it, Valerie.~
@728  = ~Thank you, but we need to get going. Time is of the essence.~
@729  = ~Certainly. Might as well tell the others we're taking a break.~
@730  = ~*sigh* Why couldn't you have been a woman...~
@731  = ~*sigh* Please stop fluttering your eyelashes at me. It's... distracting, and I don't need this right now.~
@732  = ~Certainly, <CHARNAME>.~
@733  = ~Indeed it is. By your lead.~
@734  = ~No, <CHARNAME>. Your father was Gorion. So what if Bhaal impregnated your mother? He didn't raise you. He didn't know you when you were a child. He didn't teach you, help you, or do anything at all for you. He was not your father.~
@735  = ~I think it's different when gods are involved.~
@736  = ~You know the powers I have, the ones you tried to identify? I think they're born from Bhaal's blood. He is my father.~
@737  = ~True. Bhaal may have made me, but Gorion shaped me.~
@738  = ~Valerie, please stop talking.~
@739  = ~Why? Unless you've been hiding something from me, you've never had an imp on your shoulder or voice in your head whispering life lessons to you. But fine, let's drop it and get going.~
@740  = ~And I have sorcerous powers. Be I tiefling or aasimar or dragon-blooded, I chose what I wanted to do with the powers of my nature. You can do the same. But fine, let's drop it and get going.~
@741  = ~That's good to hear. Let's get going, then.~
@742  = ~Are you sure you want to go down that road, <CHARNAME>? I'm not saying you can't use powers of unpleasant source for good like I do, but I'd be careful about asking questions you don't really want to know the answer to.~
@743  = ~You may not want to know the answers, but I do.~
@744  = ~I am not afraid of my blood. It will do as I command.~
@745  = ~Maybe you're right. Discretion might be the better part of valor.~
@746  = ~It's no use trying to dissuade you, then. Be careful, my friend.~
@747  = ~Whatever you end up deciding to do, just be careful. Power like the remnants of a dead god shouldn't be taken lightly.~
@748  = ~All I can say, then, is be careful. You have a fragment of a dead god's power, <CHARNAME>. As one of my teachers said, power corrupts. And absolute power is actually pretty neat.~

/* ---------------------------- *

 * ---------------------------- */
@749  = ~<CHARNAME>, if we have time left before the end, I'd like to stop by a courier service. I've been writing a few letters to send home.~
@750  = ~I'm sure we can make the time.~
@751  = ~Who are you writing letters to?~
@752  = ~What are the letters about?~
@753  = ~If we have time, but I'm not sure we do.~
@754  = ~I understand. Still, let me know if it's possible.~
@755  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I really appreciate it.~
@756  = ~Who are you writing to, anyway?~
@757  = ~May I ask what you're writing home about?~
@758  = ~To my superiors, my father, and... to my old girlfriend, Emma. When I sat down to write what may be my last messages home, it started to sink in just how few friends I have. Not many who would care that I may not make it back.~
@759  = ~What were you writing to them about?~
@760  = ~You don't expect to make it home after this?~
@761  = ~Cheer up. You can tell them in person.~
@762  = ~I didn't expect you of all people to sound lonely.~
@763  = ~I've been taking a long, hard look at things. What we're up against. If I don't make it back, then these are my last messages, to the people I care about and about my duty.~
@764  = ~Who are these people?~
@765  = ~You really don't think you'll make it home?~
@766  = ~And I thought we were done with mopey Valerie.~
@767  = ~What exactly are you telling them?~
@768  = ~I never thought myself short of friends either, but... I've always buried myself in study and work. Rarely went out drinking with my peers, or attended any parties. Funny the regrets you have when you stare death in the face.~
@769  = ~Are you really that pessimistic about our chances?~
@770  = ~Come on. I thought we had mopey, angsty Valerie sorted already.~
@771  = ~My superiors? Everything except what you are, which I decided was irrelevant. If we fail, they need to know what we've learned so they can finish it. To my father and Emma, that I care about them very much and what of my stuff they can have.~
@772  = ~You honestly expect us to fail?~
@773  = ~Chin up, Valerie. We'll get through this.~
@774  = ~I'm trying to be realistic. Sarevok is a match for you and then some. Who knows what other allies he has. If - *if* - the worst comes to pass, these letters will be of use.~
@775  = ~Okay, just checking that you weren't back to mopey, angsty Valerie.~
@776  = ~Good enough for me. Let's get going.~
@777  = ~I don't *seriously* expect us to fail, but I do believe in being prepared. If - *if* - the worst comes to pass, these letters will be of use.~
@778  = ~Hah. There is a line between a contingency and expecting failure. Realism, <CHARNAME>, not pessimism.~

/* ---------------------------- *
 *  Valerie Friendship Talk 17  *
 * ---------------------------- */
@779  = ~Well, it looks like this is it. One way or another, this will be over soon. <CHARNAME>... thank you for luring me away from Nashkel. I know I haven't always been the most uplifting or inspiring companion, but it has been an honor to know you, and to fight beside you. Most of all, I'm proud to call you my friend.~
@780  = ~The honor has been, and still is, mine.~
@781  = ~And thank you for coming with me. You're a good woman, and a good friend.~
@782  = ~Don't thank me yet. The hard part is yet to come.~
@783  = ~More than my friend. (Kiss Valerie)~
@784  = ~Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend, too. Come on, Sarevok's waiting.~
@785  = ~So sorry for keeping him, then.~
@786  = ~Hah. This exchange will sound good to a bard someday. Let's make sure we can tell the tale ourselves, then.~
@787  = ~Haha. I don't know if I'd have ever described myself as a good friend, but thank you all the same. May the Loyal Fury watch over you, <CHARNAME>.~
@788  = ~Come what may, I have no regrets about coming with you. If I have to die, then dying in battle to save the Sword Coast and vanquish a would-be god strikes me as a pretty good way to go.~
@789  = ~(Valerie deftly sidesteps your embrace and smiles sadly) I'm really not into guys, <CHARNAME>. Not even in the twilight hour. We're simply not meant to be.~
@790  = ~(The height difference makes a kiss rather impractical, and Valerie steps away with a sad smile) I have nothing against your people, but that's simply not going to happen. We're not meant to be.~
@791  = ~(The height difference makes a kiss rather impractical, and Valerie steps away with a sad smile) I have nothing against Yondalla's children, but that's simply not going to happen. We're not meant to be.~
@792  = ~(Valerie deftly sidesteps your embrace and smiles sadly) I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but despite all we've been through, I don't think you're the woman for me. I'm sorry.~
@793  = ~(Valerie returns your embrace with surprising energy, and after a long moment, your lips part and she smiles. Her voice is much huskier than usual) I've wanted to do that for a while now, but guess I never had the courage. It looks like we have something to talk about when this is over, now. I'm looking forward to it.~


/* ======================= *
 *  Valerie Interjections  *
 * ======================= */
@794  = ~Sirines manning the temple? Really? That's one way to get people to attend services if you have no actual spiritual counsel to give, I suppose.~
@795  = ~According to my brief, little is known for sure about what's happening here. Rumors say demons, but panicked, uneducated miners who likely never got a good look at their attackers are not reliable witnesses. The deeper levels of the mine have had recurring problems with giant spiders, oozes, and similar filth, but it's unlikely that they would be mistaken for demons. Add the tainted iron, and we fear that the miners may have found or woken something up. If they have, the best advice I can give is that we should run like hell.~
@796  = ~If I remember my history lessons right, a human culture that predates Amn in this region buried their dead in mounds like this. Unfortunately, they apparently neglected to trap and guard their tombs like most cultures in Faerun do, and so grave robbers have plundered most of the mounds. Uh. We aren't about to turn into grave robbers, too, are we?~
@797  = ~Hmmm. A shrine isn't something I expected to see down here. And I don't recognize that holy symbol at all... a skull surrounded by bolts of fire... or drops of blood? Give me a minute to sketch it in my notebook, so I can do some research in my spare time. I'll let you know if I learn anything.~
@798  = ~How - how could you do that, <CHARNAME>?! All those poor slaves... You're either profoundly callous or a monster, and I have no wish to know either sort.~
@799  = ~Oh, wow. The great library of Candlekeep... It's amazing. I know we have an urgent mission so I'll try not to dawdle, but... wow.~
@800  = ~I know it's no comfort, but I have to say something, <CHARNAME>. Who you are matters so much more than what you are. Take it from one who knows. Sorcery is trivial next to this, I know, but I like to think the principle is the same. Be the <PRO_MANWOMAN> you've become, not the child of Bhaal you were born as.~
@801  = ~Let's see what we have here. Hmmm... viscous, alchemically active liquid. And... does not like a few iron shavings at all. Hmmm. <CHARNAME>, I'd need lab equipment to study this stuff properly, but I think this is what's tainting the iron. I've heard that kobolds aren't as stupid as they appear, so this might be their handiwork.~
@802  = ~Very interesting. I've heard of books like this, <CHARNAME>. There's an enchantment woven into the very pages to improve your capabilities. And this isn't one of those knockoffs you see people trying to sell to apprentices. I can actually feel the magic in the paper. Oghma's smiling on us today.~
@803  = ~I resent that last one! Although it's odd that someone dressed as a mage herself would say that... This doesn't feel right, <CHARNAME>. Be on your guard.~
@804  = ~They are quite dangerous, I assure you! Do not listen to a word they say!~
@805  = ~For whatever it's worth, I'm sorry for your loss. People of real courage like your son are all too rare.~
@806  = ~Thank ye.~
@807  = ~The mines have been cleared, Mayor Ghastkill, and there was no demonic activity. The Cowled Wizards remain ready to assist in the event of further magical danger.~
@808  = ~Thank you, my lady. The assistance of the Cowled Wizards is greatly appreciated.~
@809  = ~I get the feeling that reasoning with these two was a lost cause.~
@810  = ~Huh?~
@811  = ~These northerners travel under the protection of the Cowled Wizards of Amn, citizen. If you would like to levy any further accusations at us, I can tell you where in Athkatla you should lodge a formal complaint.~
@812  = ~Hmph. Very well, Cowled Wizard, though I must note your exceptionally poor taste in mercenaries.~
@813  = ~Good help is hard to find, Lady Argrim. They are discrete, at least.~
@814  = ~There is something to be said for that. Very well, you may continue your business.~
@815  = ~Thank you, my lady, and we will be on our way.~
@816  = ~Thank you for handling that, Valerie. That could have gotten ugly.~
@817  = ~While I appreciate what you did, never pretend you're in charge again.~
@818  = ~You don't get to walk away, Sendai. You will pay for mocking us.~
@819  = ~It's no trouble. I don't like throwing my status around like that, but it was for the best in this case.~
@820  = ~Forgive me for helping. I won't do it again.~
@821  = ~<CHARNAME>? Are you *really* going to fight these people just because one snobbish noblewoman insulted you? I'm not afraid of fighting when we have to, but I won't be party to murder.~
@822  = ~When you put it that way, nevermind. Let's go.~
@823  = ~If this woman wanted a fight, she's got one.~
@824  = ~Sigh. Forget it. Alright, let's go.~
@825  = ~Then you fight without me. Nashkel should be warned that you kill over petty slights.~
@826  = ~A Strifeleader of Cyric judging by the holy symbol. Don't bother praying, filth. You'll see your god in person momentarily.~
@827  = ~Your death will be a worthy sacrifice to the Black Sun!~
@828  = ~A demonic chicken. Really. We must investigate this foul mystery, wouldn't you say? Uh. Please don't hit me, <CHARNAME>.~
@829  = ~Please do! *cluck*~
@830  = ~What. <CHARNAME>, if you next bring us to singing, pastel-colored animals, I am returning to Nashkel to get my head looked at by the cleric in the temple.~
@831  = ~Normally I'd agree!~
@832  = ~The ghost of Ulcaster himself, if I'm not mistaken. This was the academy he founded and lead a few hundred years ago. Hmmm... I don't know what a cleric would say about this, <CHARNAME>, but from an arcane perspective there's probably something keeping this remnant here. If we're patient, he may give us some indication of why he's still here. Sort of.~
@833  = ~I don't know. Did you see how big those spiders in the forest are?~
@834  = ~Okay, fair point. You're still gonna die anyway.~
@835  = ~Halting and exterminating filth like you is the reason the Cowled Wizards exist, warlock. We will bury you here.~
@836  = ~A Cowled Wizard of Amn, meddling in affairs she doesn't understand. How droll, and how short-lived.~
@837  = ~I second that request. Uh. I don't like how violently unstable they're looking...~
@838  = ~MAKE IT STOP!~
@839  = ~We'd make do quite well, actually, with the right touch of transmutation magic. Men aren't nearly as indispensable as they think they are. You just have to think a little sideways.~
@840  = ~Now there's a thought! You're right, figuring out the appropriate spell shouldn't be too hard.~
@841  = ~I would like to look into this, <CHARNAME>. Wizards and nymphs... it never ends well. Wizards and attractive women of any description, really.~
@842  = ~Too true. Young lady, would you care to meet me later for a drink?~
@843  = ~I'd love to, but we're rather busy at the moment. Meet at the Three Old Kegs next week?~
@844  = ~A fine idea! I look forward to it.~
@845  = ~Purging the Nashkel mines, the bandits, and the Cloakwood doesn't seem to have cooled things off any. The Iron Throne must be continuing to stir things up here, and maybe in Athkatla as well...~
@846  = ~There's too much bad blood between Baldur's Gate and Amn. Everyone's sword arms are getting twitchy, and I doubt anything short of divine intervention can calm things down now.~
@847  = ~Your minions won't save you, witch. You'll barely be a footnote in my report to the Cowled Wizards.~
@848  = ~A Cowled Wizard of Amn? Here?! Minions, tear her apart!~
@849  = ~No, Sarevok Anchev. Like father, like son. Death runs in your blood, and will be your fate.~
@850  = ~Silence, Amnish dog! Choke on the collar of the Cowled Wizards you love so much. This is between <CHARNAME> and I.~


/* =================================== *
 *  Valerie Player initiated dialogue  *
 * =================================== */
@851  = ~What do you want, <CHARNAME>?~
@852  = ~Tell me about the Cowled Wizards.~
@853  = ~Your eyes are strangely colored. Is there a story there?~
@854  = ~Is it just me, or are you attracted to women rather than men?~
@855  = ~We're an arm of the Amn government, reporting directly to the Council of Six. Our job, loosely, is to regulate and control the use of magic within our borders.~
@856  = ~Why would you feel the need to regulate the use of magic?~
@857  = ~So you can't cast magic in Amn without their permission?~
@858  = ~Surely you're not calling them saints.~
@859  = ~What about divine magic?~
@860  = ~You said they raised you.~
@861  = ~In case you haven't noticed, magic is incredibly dangerous. One evil, misguided, or just plain careless mage can inflict horrific amounts of damage. To say nothing of wild magic zones. Oghma might not like it, but our purpose is for the good of Amn.~
@862  = ~So you need their approval to cast spells in Amn?~
@863  = ~You make them sound very noble.~
@864  = ~Do you try to control the use of divine magic, too?~
@865  = ~I think you said they raised you, right?~
@866  = ~Interesting, thank you.~
@867  = ~It's not *that* hard to get a license. You just have to attend a few months' of training sessions, examinations, and interviews. Or, knowing Athkatla, just hand the right person a bag of gold.~
@868  = ~Why go to such lengths to control magic?~
@869  = ~You seem to have a very idealistic view of the group.~
@870  = ~What if you want to cast divine magic instead?~
@871  = ~You said you grew up with them, correct?~
@872  = ~I see. Thank you.~
@873  = ~Well, I believe we do a lot more good than harm. I know older wizards go rogue more often than anyone's happy about, and magic's an ugly, dangerous thing. And it's Athkatla. Corruption is something of a given, I'm afraid.~
@874  = ~Why do the Cowled Wizards want to control magic so badly to begin with?~
@875  = ~So you need their permission to cast spells in Amn?~
@876  = ~How do they feel about divine magic?~
@877  = ~Funny to think you said they raised you.~
@878  = ~Interesting perspective. Thank you.~
@879  = ~What about divine magic? We can't stop the gods from granting their favors, and our policy is strictly neutral on divine magic. Even about the Talassans, who have a big public temple in Athkatla. I don't know if I fully agree, but we have our hands full as it is.~
@880  = ~Why do you try to regulate magic at all?~
@881  = ~Odd. You usually sound quite enamored of them.~
@882  = ~So you need Cowled Wizard approval to cast arcane magic in Amn?~
@883  = ~I believe you said they raised you, right?~
@884  = ~Like most children with magical talent, yes. It's something along the lines of an orphanage, moving into a university and apprenticeship as you get older. It was certainly better than letting us develop our abilities haphazardly.~
@885  = ~So you approve of the attempt to regulate and control magic?~
@886  = ~It sounds like you need the approval of the Cowled Wizards to cast magic in Amn.~
@887  = ~You make them sound like saints.~
@888  = ~How do they regard divine magic?~
@889  = ~Interesting. Thank you.~
@890  = ~Certainly. I'm here any time you want to talk.~
@891  = ~Nothing beyond me being a magical freak, which you know already. I can see very well in the dark, and I'm told they look very pretty. That's about it.~
@892  = ~I do prefer women, yes. Exclusively so. Never did understand the girls who found men attractive. Then again, not like I had a lot of time for dating, as Emma and I found out. Before you ask, she's my ex-girlfriend. We broke up a couple of years ago due to being teenagers and thus by definition idiots.~
