@0    = ~Another group of adventurers coming to investigate the mines, I hope? I'm glad someone has worked up the nerve to do something.~
@1    = ~What do you know of the troubles in the mines?~
@2    = ~You have an Amnish accent. Are you part of the garrison force?~
@3    = ~Why isn't the garrison doing anything?~
@4    = ~You wear a mage's robes. Do you have any magic items for sale?~
@5    = ~Sorry, but I have to go.~
@6    = ~I'm sure you know about the iron contamination. Something is attacking the miners, though. Rumors say demons.~
@7    = ~Do you believe there are demons in the mines?~
@8    = ~Are you part of the garrison force?~
@9    = ~So what's your responsibility here?~
@10   = ~Thank you for your information. Farewell.~
@11   = ~Sorry, but I'm not a merchant. I am one of the Cowled Wizards of Amn.~
@12   = ~Cowled Wizards? What are they?~
@13   = ~Does that make you part of the garrison?~
@14   = ~So what are you doing here?~
@15   = ~My mistake. Farewell.~
@16   = ~I am not. I am a Cowled Wizard, and I was sent here to see if there truly are demons in the mines or not. Unfortunately, I have had no luck persuading the captain to send a force into the mines.~
@17   = ~We're planning to investigate the mines ourselves. We could use a skilled mage, if you wish to join us.~
@18   = ~Do you think there really are demons in the mines?~
@19   = ~So what do you do here exactly?~
@20   = ~What are the Cowled Wizards?~
@21   = ~I see. Thank you, and good luck.~
@22   = ~Commander Brage was about to send a force in when he went mad. Captain Bardolan is trying to get a handle on this crisis before he sends a force into the mines.~
@23   = ~So are you part of the garrison?~
@24   = ~What's your job here?~
@25   = ~Unfortunate. Good luck sorting that out.~
@26   = ~The Cowled Wizards liaise with the army when dealing with matters of a potentially arcane nature. My job is to determine whether there actually are demons in the mines or not, and if there are, to alert the rest of the Wizards.~
@27   = ~We intend to head into the mines. The aid of a skilled mage would be welcome, if you're interested.~
@28   = ~So do you think there actually are demons in the mines?~
@29   = ~Why hasn't the garrison done anything yet?~
@30   = ~Farewell, and good luck.~
@31   = ~I hope not. Personally, I do doubt it. *Something* has invaded the mines, but I'm reluctant to jump to demons when it could be something more mundane, like kobolds or goblins.~
@32   = ~We will be heading to the mines to see for ourselves. If you'd like to join us, your aid would be welcome.~
@33   = ~If there might be demons, why isn't the garrison doing anything?~
@34   = ~Good luck.~
@35   = ~The Cowled Wizards are Amn's agency for ensuring that magic is practiced safely and responsibly. We also defend Amn against threats of an arcane nature or origin.~
@36   = ~If you'd like to join us in heading into the mines ourselves, your aid would be most welcome.~
@37   = ~So are you part of the garrison force?~
@38   = ~I see. Goodbye.~
@39   = ~Join you? As in, be an adventurer? Uh. Well... I was told to investigate this, and you're investigating this... Uh. Okay, I guess. My name is Valerie Lysander, by the way.~
@40   = ~And I am <CHARNAME>. Welcome aboard!~
@41   = ~On second thought, you should probably wait here.~
@42   = ~Hello again. Any luck investigating the mines?~
@43   = ~So you're the one responsible for clearing out the mines? Well done. The Cowled Wizards extend their thanks.~
@44   = ~Why hasn't the garrison been doing anything?~
@45   = ~I am not. I am a Cowled Wizard, and I was sent here to see if there truly are demons in the mines or not. Unfortunately, I didn't have any luck persuading the captain to send a force into the mines.~
@46   = ~We found evidence that the trouble in the mines was only part of a larger problem. We could use a skilled mage, if you wish to join us.~
@47   = ~Commander Brage was about to send a force in when he went mad. The lieutenant was trying to get a handle on this crisis before he sent a force into the mines.~
@48   = ~The Cowled Wizards liaise with the army when dealing with matters of a potentially arcane nature. My job was to determine whether there actually were demons in the mines or not, and if there were, to alert the rest of the Wizards.~
@49   = ~Unfortunately, the trouble in the mines was only the tip of a very ugly iceberg. The aid of a skilled mage would be welcome, if you're interested.~
@50   = ~Why didn't the garrison do anything?~
@51   = ~The trouble in the mines was only the beginning of a larger problem. We could use your help, if you wish to come with us.~
@52   = ~Join you? As in, be an adventurer? Uh. Well... I was told to investigate this, and if this is only the beginning of a larger problem... alright. My name is Valerie Lysander, by the way.~
@53   = ~Hello again. Any luck investigating whatever the mine crisis has lead to?~
@54   = ~Some. The aid of a skilled mage would be welcome, if you're interested.~
@55   = ~Why did the garrison leave it all up to us?~
